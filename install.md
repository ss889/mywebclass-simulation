To get started with the project, you'll need to download and install several software programs. If you're using a Mac, you can download PyCharm, Python, and Git from their respective websites or from the App Store. For Windows users, you'll need to download Git and a package manager like Chocolatey.

After you have the required software installed, you can clone the project repository by opening your terminal or Git Bash (on Windows), navigating to the directory where you want to store the project, and running the command "git clone https://github.com/ss889/mywebclass-simulation.git".

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the project's dependencies by running the command "npm install" (or "yarn install" if you're using Yarn).

Once the installation is complete, you can run the project by running the command "npm start" (or "yarn start"). This will start the project and allow you to begin working on it.
